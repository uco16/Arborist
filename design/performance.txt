"A Tour of C++" performance tips:
- use constexpr's for compile-time evaluation ยง1.7 (even functions)
- use const or reference (&) in function argument to not have the cost of copying (p23) (Q: why does const not incur copying cost?)
- inline simple operations (ie no function calls in generated machine code)
- precise control of destruction

Stockfish Github:
- threading (use number of threads equal to number of CPU cores)
